### Introduction
Spark is designed to work with Python, Java, Scala and SQL. 
Spark has a vast amount of built-in library (e.g MLlib) and can read a broad type of files.

PySpark provides an API that helps the developer/data scientist to circumvent writing parallel code that may end up having issues or being very complex. It essentially handles the tasks of multiprocessing. 

Spark works closely with structured data and allows real-time querying of the data.
